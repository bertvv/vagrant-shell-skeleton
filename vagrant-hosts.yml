# vagrant_hosts.yml -- List of hosts to be created by Vagrant.
#
# This file specifies the properties of your Vagrant VMs as a YAML list of
# dicts. Each VM should at least have a `name`.
#
# For other settings (like base box, memory, IP address, extra disks, etc.),
# see the documentation on Github:
# <https://github.com/bertvv/vagrant-shell-skeleton>
#
# If you want to run an install script at creation time, ensure the directory
# provisioning/ contains a script with the name of the VM, e.g. srv001.sh.
