# vagrant_hosts.yml
#
# List of hosts to be created by Vagrant. This file controls the Vagrant
# settings, specifically host name and network settings. You should at least
# have a `name:`.  Other optional settings that can be specified:
#
# * `box`: choose another base box instead of the default one specified in
#   Vagrantfile. A box name in the form `USER/BOX` (e.g. `bento/almalinux-9`)
#   is fetched from Vagrant Cloud.
# * `box_url`: Download the box from the specified URL instead of from Atlas.
# * `memory`: The amount of memory to allocate to the VM.
# * `cpus`: The number of CPUs to allocate to the VM.
# * `ip`: by default, an IP will be assigned by DHCP. If you want a fixed
#   addres, specify it.
# * `netmask`: by default, the network mask is `255.255.255.0`. If you want
#   another one, it should be specified.
# * `mac`: The MAC address to be assigned to the NIC. Several notations are
#   accepted, including "Linux-style" (`00:11:22:33:44:55`) and "Windows-style"
#   `00-11-22-33-44-55`). The separator characters can be omitted altogether
#   (`001122334455`).
# * `intnet`: If set to `true`, the network interface will be attached to an
#   internal network rather than a host-only adapter.
# * `auto_config`: If set to `false`, Vagrant will not attempt to configure
#   the network interface.
# * `ssh_username` and `ssh_password`: Credentials for logging in to the VM (if
#   the VM does not use the default SSH key or username/password combination).
# * `synced_folders`: A list of dicts that specify synced folders. `src` and
#   `dest` are mandatory, `options:` are optional. For the possible options,
#   see the Vagrant documentation[1]. Keys of options should be prefixed with
#   a colon, e.g. `:owner:`.
#
# To enable *provisioning*, ensure the directory provisioning/ contains a script
# with the name of the VM, e.g. srv001.sh.
